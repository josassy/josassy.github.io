          <p>Hi there, I'm Josiah. I'm a full-stack software developer with a passion for building beautiful solutions that improves peopleâ€™s lives. I care deeply about best practices, accessibility, and doing things the right way the first time. Looking for a team where I can continuously challenge my technical skills, collaborate with others, and learn everything I can.  If you think I may be a good fit with your project or company, connect with me on <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/josiahlansford">LinkedIn</a>, I would love to chat!</p>

          <h3>Work Philosophy</h3>
          <p>I care deeply about the quality of my work being an accurate representation of the work ethic I bring to any organization. Below are a few principles that I apply to my work and strive to bring to any team that I am part of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If something can be done right, it should be done the right way the first time around.</li>
            <li>Maintainability is just as important as functionality, and "quick fixes" will always take more time in the long run.</li>
            <li>Write better comments. The next person reading your code has no idea what you are doing.</li>
            <li>"This way already works" is a bad excuse to avoid learning a new way of doing something.</li>
            <li>Software should be designed from the perspective of the user, not the engineer.</li>
            <li>Designing the user interface is not an optional step in implementing the functional requirements.</li>
            <li>A11y is a basic requirement of functionality, and should be treated as such.</li>
          </ul>
